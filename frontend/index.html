                <p>Broad money is a category for measuring the amount of money circulating in an economy. It is defined as the most inclusive method of calculating a given country's money supply, and includes narrow money along with other assets that can
                    be easily converted into cash to buy goods and services. <br><br><b>Benefits of Broad Money</b> Widening the scope of the total money in circulation comes with several advantages. Above all, it helps policymakers to better grasp potential
                    inflationary trends. Central banks often look at broad money, alongside narrow money, to set monetary policy.<br><br>Economists have found close links between money supply, inflation and interest rates. Central banks such as the Federal
                    Reserve use lower interest rates to increase the money supply when the goal is to stimulate the economy. Conversely, in an inflationary setting, interest rates are raised and the money supply diminishes, leading to lower prices.</p>

                <p>People living in a low-income country are far more likely to die of a communicable disease than a noncommunicable disease. Despite the global decline, six of the top 10 causes of death in low-income countries are communicable diseases.<br><br>                    Malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS all remain in the top 10. However, all three are falling significantly. The biggest decrease among the top 10 deaths in this group has been for HIV/AIDS, with 59% fewer deaths in 2019 than in 2000,
                    or 161 000 and 395 000 respectively.<br><br> Diarrhoeal diseases are more significant as a cause of death in low-income countries: they rank in the top 5 causes of death for this income category. Nonetheless, diarrhoeal diseases are
                    decreasing in low-income countries, representing the second biggest decrease in fatalities among the top 10 (231 000 fewer deaths).<br><br> Deaths due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are particularly infrequent in low-income
                    countries compared to other income groups. It does not appear in the top 10 for low-income countries yet ranks in the top 5 for all other income groups. </p>

                <div class="seperator"></div>
                <p>Economic growth – sometimes simply “growth” – typically refers to GDP growth. A country’s gross domestic product or GDP is a measure of the size and health of its economy. It is the total value of goods and services produced over a specific
                    time period.<br><br> An annual GDP growth rate of 3%, then, simply means that the economy has grown by 3% over the past year.<br><br>When GDP goes up, the economy is generally thought to be doing well. Meanwhile, weak growth signals
                    that the economy is doing poorly. If GDP falls from one quarter to the next then growth is negative. This often brings with it falling incomes, lower consumption and job cuts.<br><br> The economy is in recession when it has two consecutive
                    quarters (i.e. six months) of negative growth. Following the global financial crisis that ignited in 2007, UK GDP fell by 6%. This marked the deepest recession for 80 years. The impact on people’s lives was severe with large falls
                    in wages, restricted access to credit and many people losing their jobs.</p>
